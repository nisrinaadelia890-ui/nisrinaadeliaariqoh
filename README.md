Wispie — Quick customization notes

What I changed:
- Extracted styles to `styles.css` and applied a burgundy→cream background with gold accents and a subtle fabric + foil overlay for a luxury look.
- Updated hero layout to two-column editorial style and framed product cards.
- Added Shopee & Tokopedia badges with placeholder URLs and a WhatsApp CTA.

How to replace images and store links:
- Product images are currently using `Wispie.jpg` as a placeholder. Replace the `src` attribute in each product card with your actual image filenames (optimized JPG/WEBP preferred).
- Replace the shop links in the hero area (search for `your-shop-name`) with your real store URLs:
  - Shopee: `https://shopee.co.id/your-shop-name`
  - Tokopedia: `https://www.tokopedia.com/your-shop-name`

Tips:
- Use images sized to ~1200px on the longest side and export as WebP or optimized JPG for best quality and performance.
- If you’d like me to swap in your product images and exact store links, attach them or paste the URLs and I’ll update the site.

Files changed:
- `1ST TRIAL.html` (markup updates)
- `styles.css` (new)  

Next steps I can take (pick any):
- Replace placeholders with your images & links
- Further polish: gold foil SVG, micro-interactions, or A/B color variants
- Export a compressed production-ready CSS file
